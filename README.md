## 📊 Dataset

The project is built using the **Goodbooks-10k** dataset.

Files used during preprocessing include:

- books.csv
- ratings.csv
- book_tags.csv
- tags.csv
- to_read.csv

After preprocessing, the final dataset used by the application is:

- clean_books.csv

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load the cleaned book dataset.
2. Create a combined text feature using the **Title**, **Author**, and **Genre**.
3. Convert text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
4. Compute similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity**.
5. Recommend the most similar books based on the selected book.
